"""The management API lets you perform various neptune.ai administration actions.

- Create and delete projects
- List projects you can access
- Add and remove project members
- List members of projects and workspaces

Most actions can also be performed by service accounts.

Functions:
    get_project_list()
    create_project()
    delete_project()
    get_project_member_list()
    add_project_member()
    remove_project_member()
    get_workspace_member_list()
    add_project_service_account()
    remove_project_service_account()
    get_project_service_account_list()
    get_workspace_service_account_list()
    trash_objects()

Usage examples
--------------

Getting projects in a workspace as a list:
>>> projects = management.get_project_list()

Creating a new project:
>>> management.create_project(
...     name="ml-team/classification",
...     key="CLS",
...     visibility="workspace",
... )

Deleting a project:
>>> management.delete_project(project="ml-team/classification")

Get project members list as dictionary, with usernames as keys and roles as values:
>>> members = management.get_project_member_list(project="ml-team/classification")

Assign a user to a project and specify a role:
>>> management.add_project_member(
...    project="ml-team/classification", username="jackie", role="contributor"
... )

Remove a user from a project:
>>> management.remove_project_member(project="ml-team/classification", username="janus")

Get workspace members list as dictionary, with usernames as keys and roles as values:
>>> management.get_workspace_member_list(workspace="ml-team")

Assign service account to project:
>>> management.add_project_service_account(
...     project="ml-team/classification",
...     service_account_name="cicd@ml-team",
...     role="contributor",
... )

Remove service account from project:
>>> management.remove_project_service_account(
...     project="ml-team/classification", service_account_name="cicd@ml-team"
... )

Get list of project service accounts as dictionary, with usernames as keys and roles as values:
>>> management.get_project_service_account_list(project="ml-team/classification")

Get list of workspace service accounts as dictionary, with usernames as keys and roles as values:
>>> management.get_workspace_service_account_list(workspace="ml-team")

Move one or more Neptune objects to the project trash:
>>> project_name = "ml-team/classification"
>>> # Connect to your project:
... project = neptune.init_project(project=project_name)
>>> # Fetch runs tagged as "trash":
... runs_to_trash_df = project.fetch_runs_table(tag="trash").to_pandas()
>>> # Turn run IDs into a list:
... runs_to_trash = runs_to_trash_df["sys/id"].tolist()
>>> # Move the runs to trash:
... management.trash_objects(project=project_name, ids=runs_to_trash)
