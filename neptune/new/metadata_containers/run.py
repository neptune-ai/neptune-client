    """A Run in Neptune is a representation of all metadata that you log to Neptune.

    Beginning when you start a tracked run with `neptune.init()` and ending when the script finishes
    or when you explicitly stop the experiment with `.stop()`.

    You can log many ML metadata types, including:
        * metrics
        * losses
        * model weights
        * images
        * interactive charts
        * predictions
        * and much more

    Examples:
        >>> import neptune.new as neptune

        >>> # Create new experiment
        ... run = neptune.init('my_workspace/my_project')

        >>> # Log parameters
        ... params = {'max_epochs': 10, 'optimizer': 'Adam'}
        ... run['parameters'] = params

        >>> # Log metadata
        ... run['train/metric_name'].log()
        >>> run['predictions'].log(image)
        >>> run['model'].upload(path_to_model)

        >>> # Log whatever else you want
