class Credentials(object):
    """It formats your Neptune api token to the format that can be understood by the Neptune Client.

    A constructor allowing you to pass the Neptune API key explicitly.
    Use this method only if you're certain that your code will stay private.
    Otherwise, refer to the more secure `from_env` method.

    Args:
        api_token(str): This is a secret API key that you can retrieve by running
            `$ neptune account api-token get`

    Attributes:
        api_token:  This is a secret API key that was passed at instantiation.

    Examples:

        >>> from neptune.credentials import Credentials
        >>> credentials=Credentials('YOUR_NEPTUNE_API_KEY')

        Alternatively you can create an environment variable by running:

        $ export NEPTUNE_API_TOKEN=YOUR_API_TOKEN

        which will allow you to use the `.from_env()` method.

        >>> credentials=Credentials.from_env()

    Note:
        For security reasons it is recommended to use the `.from_env()` method to create a instantiate Credentials.
        You can create an environment variable that stores your api token.
        You can do that by going to your console and running:

        $ export NEPTUNE_API_TOKEN=YOUR_API_TOKEN`

        This is the preferred, more secure, method of building the `Credentials` object.
        This method expects Neptune API key to be present in the `NEPTUNE_API_TOKEN`
        environment variable.

        Returns:
            `neptune.credentials.Credentials`: Neptune Credentials object.

        Note:
            You can retrieve a valid Neptune API key with `neptune account api-key get`.

            When running your code in Neptune's Jupyter notebook, or via `neptune send`,
            this variable is set to a valid API key.

        Examples:
